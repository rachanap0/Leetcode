#Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. 
# Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

# Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

# Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. 
# The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
# Return k.


#Time complexity is O(n) where n is number of elements in the array

def removeElement(nums, val):
    """
    :type nums: List[int]
    :type val: int

    if not nums:

    count = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != val:
            nums[count] = nums[i]
            count +=1

#Example usage:
nums = [3,2,2,3]
val = 3
k = removeElement(nums, val)
